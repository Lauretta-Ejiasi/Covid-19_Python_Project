# Covid-19_Python_Project
Performing K-Means clustering on Covid-19
In this project i demonstrated my knowledge on:
- Python programming skills.
- Data analysis skill using Pandas.
- Applied data transformation for clustering.
- Performed Geocoding.
- Visualised COVID-19 affected areas on the world map based on geo-location using K-means clustering.

The dataset for this project was collected from: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports
(https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports)

This dataset contains latest data about spread of Covid-19 including Location, Confirmed cases, Deaths and Recovered cases. This information was provided date wise in .csv files. I downloaded all the.csv files but chose two files for a duration because i performed comparative analysis of two durations that allowed me form a hypothesis/idea, perform analysis and justified the final findings using K-Means clustering. I selected four datasets durations for our comparative analysis which are;
- Current Data: 01-01-2022 and 08-01-2022
- Previous Data: 01-01-2021 and 08-01-2021
  
This project provides baseline analysis using K-Means clustering. I also included a report section in the project discussing the experiments conducted including investigation of the given problem based on the dataset, and interpretation and comparison of the results. In doing this i considered the following points:
- Hypothesis/idea: Which included the data points (duration) that were considered for clustering (e.g. cluster highest and lowest risk areas) using K-means clustering and why.
- Gave brief description of the analysis and pre-processing performed and reason why these processes are required (e.g., itâ€™s impact on the results) talked about how K was chosen, colour scheme, how negative values were treated, etc.
- And, discussions and interpretation of the results.
  

This dataset is also available on Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019- dataset/data# (https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/data)
